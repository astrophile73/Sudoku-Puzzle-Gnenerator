Place these TTF files here to embed fonts deterministically in the interior PDF:

- NotoSans-Regular.ttf
- NotoSans-Bold.ttf

If these files are missing, the app will try system fonts (DejaVu Sans on Linux, Arial on Windows).
If no system fonts are found, the app will block export (KDP preflight fail).
